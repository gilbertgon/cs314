**   This file contains the main driver program for the final project in CSCE 314.
** The idea revolves around a Bank having two or more Users who visit business 
* and make transactions using some form of payment method we can track. When does
* a user make a transaction? Whenever the hashes of the nodes at the very bottom
* change. We take as inputs User names, types of payments, transaction information
